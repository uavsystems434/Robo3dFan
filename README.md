# Robo3dFan
This .STL file is a simple fix to a common issue specifically with the Robo 3d R1+ printer which is improper extrusion. This issue is caused by the printer not having a dedicated fan vent directed towards the extruder causing the plastic to "bubble," or even clog if severe enough. This 3d file aims to allow any standard PC fan cooler to attach to the X-axis rods and easily slide in the dedicated slot to direct air evenly towards the extruder.
